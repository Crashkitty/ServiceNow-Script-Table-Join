# ServiceNow-Script-Table-Join

This script joins the incident table and the u_customer table on the u_customer_id field, and returns the number and short_description fields from the incident table, as well as the u_name field from the u_customer table. It then loops through the results and prints the incident number, short description, and customer name to the console. You can modify this script to suit your specific needs and tables
